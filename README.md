# 3DGardenLabels
 Lovely 3D label stakes ready for your garden!

These garden labels are designed to show off the plant's main type in an interesting and easy to see way, while leaving room to write the specific species of plant on the main stake. The stakes are long enough to stick into the ground without getting lost in the garden.

**GardenStakesAll.ai** is an illustrator file that contains all of the labels laid out in one document

**PlantsList.txt** Is a text file that contains a list of all plants currently in the set

**TextAndStakeTemplate.ai** is an illustrator file that contains a blank stake and a text block that can be altered and merged with the stake to create custom labels. (If you make a custom label, please consider opening a pull request to add it to the collection!)

**Separate** is a folder that contains every label as a separate SVG file

All of these files were designed with laser cutting in mind, using a 1/4 inch piece of wood. Thinner wood would work, but the letters may be more fragile. It is possible to 3D print these stakes, but due to concerns of microplastics and pollution, I can't recommend this. There are 3D printing plastics rated for outdoor use, but why waste plastic when wood works better (and looks nicer :D)?

If there is a label you'd like that is not yet in this collection, and you don't have access to illustrator (or just don't know how to use it), [please let me know!](https://lumen-git.github.io/contact/contact.html) I'll gladly add custom labels to this collection if they're wanted!
